# Sales-Dashboard

******Goal of the Project:******

Our goal is to study retail sales data for the coffee shop. By analyzing this data, we hope to learn things that will help us improve how the coffee shop runs.

******Suggested approach******

**Sales by day and hour**: How do sales change depending on the day of the week and time of day?

**Peak sales times**: Are there specific times when sales are highest?

**Monthly sales**: What is the total sales revenue for each month?

**Sales by location**: How do sales differ between different store locations?

**Average order price**: What is the average price per order per person?

**Bestselling products**: Which products sell the most in terms of quantity and revenue?

**Sales by category and type**: How do sales vary depending on the product category and type?
